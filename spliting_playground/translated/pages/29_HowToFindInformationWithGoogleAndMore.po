"It's useful to know the functions we just covered, but it's not easy to learn them all, and there's many more. A more important skill is being able to look things up. For example, here are some typical ways you might Google the above functions if you forgot their names:\n"
"\n"
"- `append`\n"
"    - python add element to list\n"
"    - python add item at end of list\n"
"- `len`\n"
"    - python size of list\n"
"    - python number of elements in list\n"
"    - python how many characters in string\n"
"- `sum`\n"
"    - python add list of numbers\n"
"    - python total of numbers\n"
"- `in`\n"
"    - python check if list contains value\n"
"    - python test if list has element\n"
"- `index`\n"
"    - python get position of element\n"
"    - python get index of value\n"
"\n"
"Let's practice this skill now. Find a function/method that returns the value in a list which is bigger than any other value. For example, given the list `[21, 55, 4, 91, 62, 49]`, it will return `91`. You should write the answer in the shell as a single small expression. For example, if you were looking for the function `sum`, you could write `sum([21, 55, 4, 91, 62, 49])`. Don't solve this manually with a loop. Note that the function you're looking for hasn't been mentioned here before."
