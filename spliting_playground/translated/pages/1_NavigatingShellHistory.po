"Here's a tip: often you will want to re-run a previously entered bit of "
"code, or a slightly modified version of it. You can copy and paste, but "

"of code into the shell. Keep pressing it to go further back in your history,"
" and if you go too far, press the Down Arrow key to go the other way. Try "
"using it now."
