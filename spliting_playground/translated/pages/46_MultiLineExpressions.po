"Python tries to intepret this as two separate lines of code and gets confused. You need to tell it that\n"
"the first line is continuing onto the second line.\n"

"One way to do this is by adding `\\` at the end of the line to 'escape' the line break.\n"

"Another way is to ensure that the line break is contained within some kind of brackets. Then the line\n"
"continuation is implied because Python will wait till all brackets have been closed before\n"
"considering a line to be complete. If you already have brackets because for example you're calling a function\n"
"or making a list, you may not need to do anything! Otherwise you can add brackets to any expression\n"
