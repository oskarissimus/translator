"Tada! Scroll to the top of the terminal and let's walk through what `snoop` is showing you.\n"
"It starts out very straightforward:\n"
"\n"
"        1 | sentence = 'Hello World'\n"
"        3 | include = False\n"
"        4 | new_sentence = ''\n"
"        5 | for char in sentence:\n"
"     ...... char = 'H'\n"
"\n"
"The first lines are simply showing you the lines of the program that the computer ran.\n"
"On the left is the line number as seen in the editor.\n"
"\n"
"Running `for char in sentence:` assigns a value to the variable `char`, so `snoop` shows you that value.\n"
"Lines starting with `......` indicate a new variable or a change in the value of an existing variable.\n"
"Such lines will not be shown when they're redundant, which is why the `snoop` output doesn't start like this:\n"
"\n"
"        1 | sentence = 'Hello World'\n"
"     ...... sentence = 'Hello World'\n"
"        3 | include = False\n"
"     ...... include = False\n"
"        4 | new_sentence = ''\n"
"     ...... new_sentence = ''\n"
"        5 | for char in sentence:\n"
"     ...... char = 'H'\n"
"\n"
"The next two lines are:\n"
"\n"
"        6 |     if include:\n"
"        8 |     include = True\n"
"\n"
"What's important here is what's not showing: because `include` is `False`, line 7 (`new_sentence += char`) gets skipped. But then `include` is set to `True`, so the next iteration of the loop is different:\n"
"\n"
"        5 | for char in sentence:\n"
"     ...... char = 'e'\n"
"        6 |     if include:\n"
"        7 |         new_sentence += char\n"
"     .............. new_sentence = 'e'\n"
"\n"
"`new_sentence += char` runs for the first time and the variable `new_sentence` gets a new value.\n"
"\n"
"Now modify the program to do the opposite: only print the first character, leave out the rest."
