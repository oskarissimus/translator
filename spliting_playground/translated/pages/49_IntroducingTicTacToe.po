"We will break up the project into several small functions, which will be exercises.\n"
"\n"
"You will use many of the concepts you have learned so far: strings,\n"
"nested lists, nested loops, `range`, calling functions within functions, comparisons, and booleans.\n"
"\n"
"Along the way you will also learn some new concepts, including newline characters, types, and `input()`.\n"
"\n"
"Here is a rough outline of the project:\n"
"\n"
"- three functions `row_winner`, `column_winner`,  `diagonal_winner`  that check the whole board for winning rows, columns, and diagonals\n"
"- a function `winner` that checks the whole board for a winner, combining the above functions\n"
"- a function `format_board` that displays the current state of the game\n"
"- a function `play_move` that takes user input to play a move,\n"
"- finally a `play_game` function that puts it all together and runs the game interactively.\n"
"- Later on we will add further improvements.\n"
"\n"
"Let's get started!\n"
"\n"
"As in the last chapter, we will represent the tic-tac-toe board as a nested list of strings.\n"
"For a typical game this will be a 3x3 list, i.e. 3 lists each containing 3 strings, with players represented by `'X'` or `'O'`.\n"
"Empty squares will be represented by a space, i.e. `' '`. For example:\n"
"\n"
"__code0__\n"
"\n"
"However to make things more interesting your code will need to work for square boards of any size\n"
"(4x4, 5x5, etc) where players can be represented by any strings, e.g.\n"
"\n"
"__code1__\n"
"\n"
"Write a function `row_winner` which returns `True` if `board` contains\n"
"a winning row, i.e. a horizontal line which has the same character in all its entries (except `' '`):\n"
"\n"
"    __copyable__\n"
"__code2__\n"
"\n"
"In the second example, `O` wins in the bottom row."
